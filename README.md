As a current Division I athlete, I wanted to work on a final project that could make a meaningful contribution to my athletics community. In recent years, transferring has been a hot topic in the NCAA as 13% of current Division I student-athletes transferred from another school (https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research-student-athlete-transfers). 

To attempt to understand this phenomenon, I found a dataset on Kaggle that looked at four-year retention rates – the percentage of athletes that stay at a school over a four-year period– for various schools and sports. For my final project, I attempted to create a model that can predict retention rate of a sport based on relatively few features. The goal, however, was less about prediction and more about interpretation to see if I could provide insights on the rising NCAA transfer rates. What I found, was that sport and four-year eligibility were the most important features in predicting retention rates. This is important because the NCAA could take a deeper look into these sports or push coaches to keep more students eligible to see if there are any trends that could explain their high transfer rates.
